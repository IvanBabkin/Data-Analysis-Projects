# COVID19 Daily Cases and Deaths Data Analysis
* This project analyses data for daily COVID19 cases and deaths around the world
* The project is similar to [coursera's guided project](https://www.coursera.org/projects/covid19-data-analysis-using-python) but different data was used
and therefore it had to be cleaned and prepared differently
## Data
Below are the sources that were used to obtain the data for the project
